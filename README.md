### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

My focus during this project was around the creation of the synergy between the various components. I chose this goal as I am familar with the concept of various componets, but I wanted to impove of the blending with the hope of understanding SwiftUI in particular. This included understanding best pratices in SwiftUI instead of just translating my work with objective-c

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spend approximately 10 hours on the project. I allocated my time into chunks with each time being one step in the process. This included first inital loading of recipes, then visual display, followed by image loading, and then image caching. Afterward was cleanup and included testing. In those chunks I worked on spending time planning out my goal, doing reaseach on ways of approach and then attempting a solution.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
My trade-offs for this project were in regards to consitency vs complexity. I chose to provide a consistent experience, that I am proud of versus highlighting any one part of the application over the other. This leads to some parts like the caching to be a bit simple, but I wanted to accomplish the goal setout before I start getting too much into the "what abouts"

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Due to the previous mention of consitency vs complexity, I feel the weakest part is the Caching. There is much I would have liked to add but I already spent above the expect time. So this left the caching as the weakest part, although it does accomplish it's goal.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
It might be a bit redundant at this point, but a large part of this project was me wanting to feel confident in every part of the project, I learned a lot throughout my time and it perhaps made it take a little longer then it realisticly should, but the upside is that I can talk alot about every decisions made.
